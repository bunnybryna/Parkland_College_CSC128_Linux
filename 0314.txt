changed to private: chmod 
rwx rwx rwx, 6 0 0, 110 000 000
read write execute
chmod 600 day2.txt
Permissions:
1 – can execute
2 – can write
4 – can read
The octal number is the sum of those free permissions, i.e.
3 (1+2) – can execute and write
6 (2+4) – can write and read
Position of the digit in value:
1 – what owner can
2 – what users in the file group(class) can
3 – what users not in the file group(class) can
Examples:
chmod 600 file – owner can read and write
chmod 700 file – owner can read, write and execute
chmod 666 file – all can read and write
chmod 777 file – all can read, write and execute
644 standard permission 
4 is read
5 is read/execute (execute is always needed for directories)
6 is read/write
7 is read, write, and execute

if chmod 000, even the user self can't see the file, used as backup file

if we delete the original file(pass_copy), then  cat passwd_copy_soft
cat: passwd_copy_soft: No such file or directory

you can cat soft link again
